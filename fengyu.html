        <p>Smoothie has been dubbed the "world's most photogenic cat", and her emerald eyes and golden fur have even inspired a mural in New Zealand. Smoothie also has an aptly-named brother named Milkshake, and the two are often featured together across social media platforms. She became an internet sensation with 2.3 million followers on her smoothiethecat Instagram account.</p>
